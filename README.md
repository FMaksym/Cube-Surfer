Endless runner in hyper casual style. Designed for PC and mobile devices.
In the game you can see:
  - spawn road elements;
  - removal of the last elements of the road;
  - game logic (collision with obstacles, drop new blocks and their loss in case of a collision with an obstacle);
  - when picking up a new block, you can see the effect of floating text that indicates that the player picked up +1 block;
  - when the main unit collides with a target, the game ends and the phone vibrates;
